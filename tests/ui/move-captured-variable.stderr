   | |                   move occurs because `a` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   | |                   move occurs due to use in generator
12 | |         };
   | |__________^ move out of `a` occurs here

   = note: this error originates in the macro `stream_block` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
