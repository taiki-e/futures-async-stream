error[E0507]: cannot move out of `a`, a captured variable in an `FnMut` closure
  --> tests/ui/move-captured-variable.rs:12:9

10 |       let a = String::new();
   |           -   ------------- move occurs because `a` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

   | |                   - variable moved due to use in coroutine
